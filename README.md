### About DIS

DataMiner effortlessly communicates with any device from any vendor, seamlessly gathering valuable data and presenting it in a unified, intuitive interface. This connection is made possible by the powerful DataMiner connectors, also known as "drivers" or "protocols". A DataMiner connector, an XML file brimming with crucial information, empowers DataMiner to establish seamless communication with your devices.

Besides building connectors, DataMiner Integration Studio empowers you to create automation scripts for your DataMiner System, opening up a multitude of possibilities. These scripts can seamlessly handle a diverse range of tasks, encompassing backup routines, system configuration, channel selection, report generation, and notifications via email or SMS, among many others

With DataMiner Integration Studio (DIS) you can build, edit, validate, and publish connectors and scripts. It's a remarkable plugin for Visual Studio that takes the development of DataMiner connectors and automation scripts to new heights, offering a range of intriguing features.
